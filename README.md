Forming part of the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course,
This project folder is a work in progress covering the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

Learning how to extract and identify useful features that best represent this data, a few of the most
important machine learning algorithms, and how to evaluate the performance of these machine learning
algorithms.

Supervised & Unsupervised methods covered include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision
Trees, Regressions, Outliers, Clustering and Feature Scaling.
